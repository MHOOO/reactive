<h2>Properties/Attributes</h2>
<p>Events are the mechanism by which events get from
the browser to your code running on the server.
There is another mechanism that builds on events,
and that is properties or attributes. This
allows you to access and modify the browser's
state. The property's state is sent to
your code on the server with events.
Modifications to properties are sent to the
browser with
the JavaScript queuing mechanism.</p>

<h3><code>DOMProperty</code></h3>
<p><code>DOMProperty</code>
wraps a <code>Var</code> which maintains
the state of the element property. Like
<code>DOMEventSource</code>, it has an <code>apply</code>
method that takes and returns an <code>Elem</code>.
In the case of <code>DOMProperty</code>, it
returns an element with an added attribute
corresponding the property and its value.
In addition, any events it was linked to by
calling <code>withEvents</code> will also
be applied to the element. Also, if the element
does not have an <code>id</code> attribute
one will be added. Unlike <code>DOMEventSource</code>,
this <code>apply</code> method takes an
implicit <code>Page</code> (which defaults to
the current Lift request). The element's id will be
stored in the <code>DOMProperty</code> for that
<code>Page</code>. And like <code>DOMEventSource</code>,
<code>DOMProperty</code> extends <code>NodeSeq=&gt;NodeSeq</code>,
so you can use it with CSS Selectors and binding.</p>

<p>The simplest way to instantiate a <code>DOMProperty</code>
is by writing <code>DOMProperty("name")(aVar)</code>.</p>

<pre class="brush:scala">
  class Snippet {
    val value = Var("")
    def render =
      "input" #> DOMProperty("value")(value)
  }
</pre>

<p>That factory takes an implicit <code>PropertyCodec</code> parameter, which specifies how to
represent the <code>Var</code>'s type in the browser. There are default implicit instances
for <code>String</code>, <code>Int</code>, <code>Option[Int]</code> (<code>None</code> is represented as <code>-1</code>),
and <code>Boolean</code> (<code>false</code> generates no attribute, <code>true</code> generates an attribute with the value set to its name,
as in <code>checked="checked"</code>).</p>


<p>Here are some of <code>DOMProperty</code>'s members:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><code>value</code></dt>
  <dd>The most important member: this is the <code>Var</code> that
  we mentioned. Setting its value will result in the corresponding
  property being changed in the browser on whichever <code>Page</code>s
  are registered with this <code>DOMProperty</code> (whether via Ajax or
  Comet) except for the <code>Page</code> that is currently firing an
  Ajax event that is setting its value, if any.</dd>
  <dt><code>updateOn</code></dt>
  <dd>Calling this method with one or more <code>DOMEventSource</code>s will
  add an element to its <code>rawEventData</code> with a JavaScript
  expression that reads the value of this property. When <code>Page</code>s
  are added subsequently, the value of the property will be updated via
  the <code>rawEventStream</code>.</dd>
  <dt><code>withEvents</code></dt>
  <dd>Like <code>updateOn</code>, plus
  the <code>DOMProperty</code> will automatically
  add the events to the element.</dd>
</dl>
