<h2>Low Level API</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Most of the time you don't need to think about <code>reactive-web</code>'s
internals. However, to reason about more complex situations, it may be
helpful to understand what's happening behind the scenes. That said, the
following is not meant to paint a picture about typical usage of the
library.</p>
<p>At its heart, deep down, <code>reactive-web</code> is just a
simple abstraction over Lift's superb Ajax and Comet support. It allows
you to demarcate a dynamic scope (think <code>scala.util.DynamicVariable</code>'s
<code>withValue</code> / <code>net.liftweb.util.ThreadGlobal</code>'s <code>doWith</code>)
in which code can queue JavaScript to be executed in the browser. How
the JavaScript is sent to the browser depends on the dynamic scope:
either the current thread is responding to an Ajax call, and the queued
JavaScript will be accumulated and returned as the Ajax response; or the
current thread has a scope associated with a particular <code>Page</code>,
and when the thread exits the scope, the JavaScript will be sent to the
Comet actor associated with that <code>Page</code>. It is a runtime
error to queue JavaScript when not inside any scope.</p>
<p>Note that if in your application nothing happens after page load
that is not in response to a browser event, you do not need to put
enable Comet support. However, if you do need Comet support, you need
to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Add to Boot.boot: <pre class="brush:scala">
Reactions.initComet
</pre></li>
	<li>Add to each page (this could be via the surrounding template)
	<em>before</em> any snippet invocation that uses <code>reactive-web</code>:
	<pre class="brush: xml">
&lt;div class="lift:reactive"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre></li>
</ol>
<p><code>reactive-web</code> builds on this, and on <code>reactive-core</code>,
to provide concise, composable abstractions for rendering highly
interactive and dynamic browser content.</p>
<p>So what is a <code>Page</code>? Well, really all it does is hold
a unique id. But Comet actors are named based on this id, keeping a
separate flow of updates to separate pages. And, as mentioned above,
it's used to associate a scope with a Comet actor. Similarly, browser
content is associated with one or more <code>Page</code>s, which they
keep themselves updated on. In addition, <code>Page</code> extends <code>Observing</code>,
so by having one in the implicits scope (as is the case if your snippet
extends <code>ReactiveSnippet</code>), you can <code>foreach</code> over
events.</p>

<p>The simplest way to experience how <code>reactive-web</code>
interacts with the browser at the low level is perhaps the <code>confirm</code>
method (a member of the package object), which triggers its JavaScript
namesake.</p>

<pre class="brush:scala">
confirm("Are you sure you want to delete XXX?"){
  case true =&gt; xxx.delete
}
</pre>

<p>What happens is that when you call confirm, <code>reactive-web</code>
queues JavaScript that calls confirm in the browser, and sends the
return value back to your application via Ajax.</p>

<p>Here's the implementation:</p>
<pre class="brush:scala">
def confirm(message: String)(response: PartialFunction[Boolean, Unit])(implicit page: Page): Unit = {
  val funcWrapper: String=&gt;Unit = {
    case "true" =&gt; if(response.isDefinedAt(true)) response(true)
    case "false" =&gt; if(response.isDefinedAt(false)) response(false)
  }
  val js = S.fmapFunc(S.contextFuncBuilder(RElem.ajaxFunc(funcWrapper))) {funcId =&gt;
    SHtml.makeAjaxCall(
      JsRaw("'"+funcId+"='+confirm(" + Str(message).toJsCmd + ")")
    ).toJsCmd
  }
  Reactions.inAnyScope(page)(
    Reactions.queue(
      JsCmds.Run(js)
    )
  )
}
</pre>
<p>Let's break that up:</p>
<pre class="brush:scala">
def confirm(message: String)(response: PartialFunction[Boolean, Unit])(implicit page: Page): Unit = {
</pre>
<p>Okay, so we take in a message to display, and a <code>PartialFunction</code>
to handler the result (it can handle neither, one, or both Boolean
values). And we require a <code>Page</code>, normally passed in
implicitly.</p>

<pre class="brush:scala">
  val funcWrapper: String=&gt;Unit = {
    case "true" =&gt; if(response.isDefinedAt(true)) response(true)
    case "false" =&gt; if(response.isDefinedAt(false)) response(false)
  }
</pre>
<p>The above simply wraps the <code>PartialFunction</code> in a
regular function, to be called via Ajax.</p>
<pre class="brush:scala">
  val js = S.fmapFunc(S.contextFuncBuilder(RElem.ajaxFunc(funcWrapper))) {funcId =&gt;
    SHtml.makeAjaxCall(
      JsRaw("'"+funcId+"='+confirm(" + Str(message).toJsCmd + ")")
    ).toJsCmd
  }
</pre>
<p>This is regular Lift code: we're generating JavaScript to call
our Ajax function with whatever <code>confirm</code> returns.</p>
<p>Now for the <code>reactive-web</code> part:</p>
<pre class="brush:scala">
  Reactions.inAnyScope(page)(
    Reactions.queue(
      JsCmds.Run(js)
    )
  )
</pre>
<p>In order to understand the above code, it is helpful to be aware
of two other methods on the <code>Reactions</code> singleton: <code>inClientScope</code>
and <code>inServerScope</code>. <code>inClientScope</code> takes a block
of code and executes it with a dynamic scope that is client-side,
meaning that the code is executing in response to an Ajax call triggered
by the client (browser). <code>inClientScope</code> runs the code block
and stores up all JavaScript it queues -- and the accumulated JavaScript
becomes its return value. (Browser events are wired up by adding event
handlers in the browser that call an Ajax function which fires the
server events inside of a call to <code>inClientScope</code>, then
returning its return value back to the browser.) Then there's <code>inServerScope</code>,
which takes a <code>Page</code> and a code block, and all JavaScript
queued by the code block is sent to the Comet actor associated with the
<code>Page</code>.</p>
<p>Both of the above methods temporarily overwrite whatever the
current scope was before (of course it's restored after the code block
is run). What if you have code that needs to run in some <code>Reactions</code>
scope, but it should be agnostic as to which one? That's what <code>Reactions.inAnyScope</code>
is for. It needs a <code>Page</code>, in case it's going to run in
server scope, but what it does is that if there already is a <code>Reactions</code>
scope, the code is just executed in the existing scope. If there is no
current <code>Reactions</code> scope, then it enters a new server scope
to run the code.</p>
<p>So we call <code>Reactions.inAnyScope</code>, and pass it a code
block that calls <code>Reactions.queue</code>, with <code>js</code> (a <code>String</code>)
wrapped in a <code>JsCmd</code>.</p>
