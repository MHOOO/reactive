<h2>Events</h2>
<p>Reactive-web is to a large extent about browser events.
By events we mean any event the browser can
fire for a given element. For instance, mouse
interactions and keyboard input. Sometimes
you want to react to events directly. Additionally,
element properties make use of events to stay
up to date.</p>

<h3><code>DOMEvent</code></h3>
<p><code>DOMEvent</code>
is a simple trait that represents the event object that is raised by the browser. It is extended
by case classes and case objects that represent the various
DOM events and their state. When the browser fires an event, <code>reactive-web</code>
may fire a corresponding DOMEvent instance to your code.</p>

<h3><code>DOMEventSource</code></h3>
<p>Now that we know about that, let's move on to <code>DOMEventSource</code>.
<code>DOMEventSource</code> wraps an <code>EventStream</code> that fires
<code>DOMEvent</code> instances. It adds the
ability to generate an element attribute that
assigns an event handler which triggers the
<code>EventStream</code> via ajax.</p>

<p>You can create a <code>DOMEventSource</code> simply by
instantiating it with the event type as a type parameter:</p>

<pre class="brush: scala">
new DOMEventSource[Focus]
</pre>

<p>For convenience, the <code>DOMEventSource</code>
companion object contains convenience methods,
so you can just write, e.g., <code>DOMEventSource.click</code>.</p>

<p>If you have an <code>Elem</code> you can
pass it to <code>EventStream</code>'s <code>apply</code>
method and get back a new <code>Elem</code>
with the event handler attribute. Also,
<code>DOMEventSource</code> extends <code>NodeSeq=&gt;NodeSeq</code>, so
you can use it with Lift's CSS Selectors or binding. For example:</p>


<pre class="brush:xml">
&lt;!-- in the template --&gt;
&lt;button&gt;Delete!&lt;/button&gt;
</pre>
<pre class="brush:scala">
// in the snippet class
def render = {
  val click = DOMEventSource.click
  for(_ &lt;- click.eventStream)
    confirm("Are you sure you want to delete it?"){
      case true =&gt; //delete it
    }
  "button" #> click
}
</pre>

<p>Here are a few of its members:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><code>rawEventData</code></dt>
  <dd>A <code>Map[String,JsExp]</code> of extra data to send in the
  ajax request when the browser fires the event. The <code>JsExp</code>
  values are JavaScript expressions that will be evaluated when the event
  fires and stored under the specified key.</dd>
  <dt><code>rawEventStream</code></dt>
  <dd>This <code>EventStream</code> fires the raw data from the ajax
  request. Each event has the type <code>Map[String,String]</code>, where
  keys are taken from <code>rawEventData</code>, and values are the
  result of evaluating the corresponding <code>JsExp</code>.</dd>
  <dt><code>eventStream</code></dt>
  <dd>The <code>EventStream</code> that fires <code>DOMEvent</code>s.
  The data also exists in raw form in <code>rawEventStream</code></dd>
</dl>
