<h2>About</h2>
<p>Reactive-web is new RIA framework, making it easy to write highly
interactive web applications, similar to GWT, Flex, etc. It's written in
<a href="http://scala-lang.org">Scala</a> , sits on top of <a
  href="http://liftweb.net">Lift</a>, and uses the Functional Reactive
Programming library reactive-core (it's in the same repository).</p>
<p>It allows your webapp to interact with browser elements as if
they were regular Scala objects inside the JVM, giving you the
simplicity of GWT. You can handle events from DOM objects in Scala code,
and you can update DOM objects by mutating the corresponding object in
Scala. More importantly though, you can define relationships
declaratively so that it will be updated automatically, like binding in
JavaFX and Flex.</p>
<p>Updates to the browser in response to events that originated from
the browser are returned from the same ajax request that the event was
sent through. Events that originate from stimuli on the server can be
sent through Lift's superb comet support.</p>
<p>Reactive has powerful support for incremental updates. So you can
have a set of items transformed it in all sorts of ways and rendered,
and when the set of items changes, only the necessary changes will be
made to the DOM.</p>
<p>You can use it within a regular Lift application, in one place or
throughout. Or you can use it to completely change the kind of webapps
you write. No longer do webapps have to be less dynamic than GUI
applications. You can even use it to build a rich desktop GUI app, using
an embedded Jetty instance.</p>
<p>The code is at <a href="http://github.com/nafg/reactive">http://github.com/nafg/reactive</a>.
Note that while there is still much to be done, it's more in terms of
completeness (like adding more elements and properties) than in terms of
plumbing.</p>
<p>It can integrate with the Lift templating mechanism, so you can
keep view design completely separate from your code.</p>
<p>Looking forward to your constructive criticism! (You can discuss
reactive on the <a href="scala-user@googlegroups.com">scala-user</a> or
<a href="mailto:liftweb@googlegroups.com">Lift</a> lists, or you can <a
