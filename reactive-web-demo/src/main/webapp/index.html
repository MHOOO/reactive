  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Reactive-web is a new framework for writing highly interactive and
    dynamic web applications. It's written in <a
      href="http://scala-lang.org">Scala</a> , sits on top of <a
      href="http://liftweb.net">Lift</a>, and uses the Functional
    Reactive Programming library reactive-core (it's in the same
    repository).
  </p>
  <p>As in GWT, you code your logic as part of your program (except
    in Scala instead of Java), rather than writing JavaScript. Unlike
    GWT, however, your code does not need to be converted to JavaScript.
    Also, you can declare dynamic relationships between components, like
    binding in Flex or JavaFX.</p>

  <p>Your webapp can interact with browser elements as if they were
    regular objects inside the JVM. You can handle events from DOM
    elements in your code, and you can update DOM objects by mutating
    the corresponding object. And you can assign dynamically evaluated
    expressions, and the browser will update automatically (more
    powerfully than with Lift's built in wiring).</p>
  <p>Reactive has powerful support for incremental updates. So you
    can have a set of items transformed it in all sorts of ways and
    rendered, and when the set of items changes, only the necessary
    changes will be made to the DOM.</p>
  <p>You can use it within a regular Lift application, in one place
    or throughout. Or you can use it to completely change the kind of
    webapps you write. No longer do webapps have to be less dynamic than
    GUI applications. You can even use it to build a rich desktop GUI
    app &mdash; just use an embedded Jetty.</p>
  <p>It integrates very well with the Lift template binding mechanism, so you
    can keep view design completely separate from your code.</p>
  <p>Updates to the browser in response to events that originated
    from the browser are returned from the same ajax request that the
    event was sent through. Events that originate from stimuli on the
    server can be sent through Lift's superb comet support.</p>

    You can discuss reactive on the <a
      href="scala-user@googlegroups.com">scala-user</a> or <a
      href="mailto:liftweb@googlegroups.com">Lift</a> lists, or you can

      github</a>. Looking forward to your constructive criticism!
  </p>
  <p>
    The code is at <a href="http://github.com/nafg/reactive">http://github.com/nafg/reactive</a>.
    Note that while there is still much to be done, it's more in terms
    of completeness (like adding more elements and properties, and more
    features) than in terms of plumbing or usability.
  </p>
  <p>Some planned features include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Onsubmit event, so you can use it when JavaScript is not
      enabled or supported</li>
    <li>JavaScript events and signals so components can update each
      other without an Ajax call.</li>
    <li>Intermediate, semantic representation of DOM mutations, with the
    following benefits:
    <ol><li>Extreme testability. Mutations can apply themselves
    to xml in memory, so you can GUI test without GUI testing, meaning
    you can easily simulate browser interactions and their analyze their
    consequences.</li>
    <li>Pluggability. Javascript can be generated in various forms, for
    example jQuery vs. YUI vs. plain javascript; minified vs. debuggable;
    plain vs. with transition effects.</li>
    <li>Prevent memory leaks from javascript event streams.</li>
    <li>Perhaps, a provide a simpler way for pages to work without
    javascript.</li>
    </ol></li>
    <li>Widgets, from scratch and/or ExtJS etc.</li>
  </ul>
