You may use this software under the following conditions:
A. You must not use it in any way that encourages transgression of the Seven Noahide Laws (as defined by traditional Judaism; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Laws_of_Noah is pretty good). They are:
  1. Theft
  2. Murder
  3. Adultery
  4. Polytheism
  5. Cruelty to animals (eating a limb of a living animal)
  6. Cursing G-d
And they require a fair judicial system.

B. You must not use it in any way that transgresses the Apache Software License.
